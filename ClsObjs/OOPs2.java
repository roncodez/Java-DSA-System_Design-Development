In Java, constructors are not inherited. When a class inherits another class, it does not
inherit the constructor of the parent class. However, the constructor of the parent class
can be called from the child class's constructor using the super keyword. This is often
necessary to ensure that the parent class is properly initialized when creating an instance
of the child class.

/*
Whenever there is a function with the same name in the parent and child class both, i.e. Method overriding
the function in the child class will be called. @Override
